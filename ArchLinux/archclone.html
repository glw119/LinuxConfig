<h1>How to clone an Arch Linux installation</h1>

<p>
This also works to install Arch on a disk that is to become the system disk of
another computer.  This is briefly described
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_Existing_Linux">here</a><img src="/ico/el.png">, but
there are some additional caveats as well as shortcuts if you already have a
comparable system.  To make best use of this, you need an internal or external
enclosure in which you can attach a bare hard disk to your computer (otherwise,
you would have to temporarily build the new system disk into your existing
computer).  This is how I have repeatedly created new Arch Linux installations
both at work and at home.
</p>
<p>
To avoid confusion farther on, let me give names to the three systems involved:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The target system is the installation we are creating</li>
<li> The host system is the one to which the new system disk is attached</li>
<li> The template system is the existing system that is to be cloned
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The three systems need not all be different -- for example, the template system
could be the same as the host system.  The template system may not exist at
all, if you want to create a new installation rather than clone one.  The host
system has to be able to run software on the target system, but otherwise need
not be the same CPU architecture -- for example, it may be an x86_64 system
when you want to create an i686 system.
</p>
<p>
I will assume you have already partitioned the target disk and created a file
system on the system partition.  Then you proceed as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li> If you have a template system, copy the packages
  <tt>/var/cache/pacman/pkg/*</tt> and the databases <tt>/var/lib/pacman/sync/*</tt> from
  it to the target disk (after creating the directories).</li>
<li> Extract (with <tt>tar</tt>) the following packages to the root of the target
  system in the given order, to get a minimal system to work with:
  <pre>
filesystem
bash gawk grep file glibc ncurses readline sed
acl archlinux-keyring attr bzip2 coreutils curl e2fsprogs expat gcc-libs gnupg gpgme keyutils krb5 libarchive libassuan libgpg-error libgcrypt libidn libssh2 lz4 lzo openssl pacman xz zlib
pacman-mirrorlist tar libcap arch-install-scripts util-linux systemd
  </pre>
  This list of packages is copied from the shell script
  <a href="https://github.com/tokland/arch-bootstrap/blob/master/arch-bootstrap.sh"><tt>arch-bootstrap.sh</tt></a><img src="/ico/el.png"> linked from the
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_Existing_Linux">Wiki
  page</a><img src="/ico/el.png">, look there for an up-to-date list.</li>
<li> If you do not have a template system, you can run the script
  <tt>arch-bootstrap.sh</tt> which downloads the packages above.  You have to
  customise it before running it: Choose your Arch mirror, target root
  directory and system architecture.  The script also tries to perform some of
  the following steps, but in my experience this never works 100% and has to be
  postprocessed manually.</li>
<li> Select a mirror in <tt>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</tt> on the target installation
  and set the architecture explicitly in <tt>/etc/pacman.conf</tt> if it is not the
  same as the host.  Pacman refuses to even install packages from the cache
  when no mirror is selected.</li>
<li> Install the
  <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/arch-install-scripts/"><tt>arch-install-scripts</tt></a><img src="/ico/el.png">
  package on the host.  This contains the <tt>arch-chroot</tt> script which creates
  bind mounts for <tt>/proc</tt> and <tt>/dev</tt> and others before chroot'ing, which
  saves a lot of hassle.  If you host runs a different Linux, you could try
  downloading the scripts from
  <a href="https://projects.archlinux.org/arch-install-scripts.git">here</a><img src="/ico/el.png">, but you may
  have to make modifications to <tt>arch-chroot</tt> if it is not completely
  compatible.
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_from_Existing_Linux#Creating_the_chroot">This
  section</a><img src="/ico/el.png"> describes how to do the necessary bind mounts manually.  (One should
  mention that <tt>--rbind</tt> mounts are next to impossible to unmount again
  &mdash; try something like <tt>grep &lt;mountpoint&gt;  /proc/mounts | awk '{ print
  $2; }' | sort -ru | while read m ; umount -n $m ; done</tt> or be prepared to
  reboot.)</li>
<li> <tt>arch-chroot</tt> into the target system (as root).</li>
<li> Initialise pacman's keyring: <pre>
pacman-key --init 
pacman-key --populate archlinux
</pre></li>
<li> Run <tt>pacman -S --force ...</tt> to reinstall the packages we unpacked
  manually above, except for <tt>pacman</tt> and <tt>arch-install-scripts</tt>.</li>
<li> Again select your mirror in <tt>/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist</tt> as this was
  overwritten by reinstalling <tt>pacman-mirrorlist</tt>.</li>
<li> Reinstall the remaining two packages <tt>pacman -S --force pacman
  arch-install-scripts</tt>.</li>
<li> Set the architecture in <tt>/etc/pacman.conf</tt> again if not the same as the
  host.</li>
<li> Make a list of the packages installed on the template system: <pre>
pacman -Qneq | sort &gt; /root/tmp/explicit-packages
pacman -Qndq | sort &gt; /root/tmp/depend-packages
</pre>
  The list of dependency packages may not be strictly necessary.  It helps
  recreate exactly the same system in case you came to rely on a dependency
  package that is not needed by an explicitly installed package any more and
  would therefore not be installed automatically.  The sorting is also not
  necessary, but allows to compare lists with <tt>diff</tt> between different
  systems or times.</li>
<li> Install these packages on the target system after transferring the lists to
  somewhere on the target system: <pre>
cat /root/tmp/explicit-packages | pacman -S --needed -
cat /root/tmp/depend-packages | pacman -S --needed --asdeps -
</pre>
  The <tt>--needed</tt> prevents reinstallation of packages we installed already.
  As noted above, installing the dependency packages may be redundant.  (The
  pacman commands above are from the commendable Wiki page
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_Tips">&quot;pacman tips&quot;</a><img src="/ico/el.png">.)</li>
<li> Copy configuration files from the template system and/or configure
  <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, <tt>/etc/hostname</tt>, <tt>/etc/localtime</tt>, <tt>/etc/locale.gen</tt>,
  <tt>/etc/locale.conf</tt>, <tt>/etc/vconsole.conf</tt> manually as described
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">here</a><img src="/ico/el.png">.</li>
<li> Install the bootloader, for example by running <tt>syslinux-install_update -i
  -a -m</tt> for syslinux (still from the chroot) as described
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syslinux">on its Wiki page</a><img src="/ico/el.png">.</li>
<li> Run <tt>mkinitcpio -p linux</tt> from the chroot.</li>
<li> ... (More configuration and installation that may be more comfortable from
  the host system.)</li>
<li> Attach the target system disk to the target hardware.</li>
<li> When booting the new box for the first time, boot into &quot;Arch Linux
  Fallback&quot;.  <tt>mkinitcpio</tt> minimises the normal &quot;Arch Linux&quot; boot to contain
  only drivers needed for the system on which it is run, i.e. the host system
  in our case.</li>
<li> Rerun <tt>mkinitcpio -p linux</tt> on the target system to get a working and
  fast-booting normal boot option.</li>
<li> ... (More configuration and installation on the target system)
</li>
</ul>
